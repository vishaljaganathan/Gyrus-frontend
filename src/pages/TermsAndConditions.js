                <li>
                  Collect, store, use and disclose the identification

                  Encrypt the identification information provided by the Pro
                  User on receipt and decrypt it at the time of verification.
                  After the completion of the verification process, the

                  on our servers (on servers in India or other countries);

            <li>
              The account details should belong to the same person registering

              it and the Registered User cannot share/transfer/resell the
              account. Any act of such sharing of account details could
              potentially lead to blocking of account permanently and/or legal
              actions.
